# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input. Players interact with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Description

This console-based implementation of the Game of Life allows you to visualize the evolution of cell states over generations. The cells can be either alive ('#') or dead (' '). The project includes color-coded cells for enhanced visualization.

## How to Run

To run the Game of Life, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/game-of-life-your_name-your_td_number.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd game-of-life-your_name-your_td_number
   ```

3. Run the script:

   For Python:

   ```bash
   python game_of_life.py
   ```

   Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
